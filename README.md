# Quantum Random Number Generator using Qiskit

This project demonstrates a quantum random number generator (QRNG) using Qiskit, a quantum computing framework in Python developed by IBM. The generator leverages quantum superposition and measurement to produce random numbers within a specified range.

## Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG)

Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG) differs from classical methods by utilizing quantum mechanical phenomena to generate truly random numbers. In quantum computing, superposition and measurement of quantum states are key principles used in QRNG:

- **Superposition**: Quantum bits (qubits) can exist in multiple states simultaneously, representing all possible outcomes.
- **Measurement**: The act of measuring collapses the superposition into a definite state, producing a random outcome based on quantum probabilities.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x                           # Python version requirement
- Qiskit (install via `pip install qiskit`)   # Qiskit installation command
- Matplotlib (install via `pip install matplotlib`)   # Matplotlib installation command
- Numpy (install via `pip install numpy`)   # Numpy installation command
